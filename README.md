# Predicting Heart Disease - Classification Problem

## 1. Problem Definiton:

    > Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2. Data Dictionary:

    > https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

## 3. Evaluation:
    > If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

## 4. Features:
    
    Only 14 attributes used:
    1. age
    
    2. sex (male = 1; female = 0)
    
    3. cp: chest pain type
           -- Value 1: typical angina
           -- Value 2: atypical angina
           -- Value 3: non-anginal pain
           -- Value 4: asymptomatic
           
    4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) 
    
    5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
    
    6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) 
    
    7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
               -- Value 0: normal
               -- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
               -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria 
                
    8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved 
    
    9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 
    
    10. oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
    
    11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
               -- Value 1: upsloping
               -- Value 2: flat
               -- Value 3: downsloping
               
    12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) col1ored by flourosopy 
    
    13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect 
    
    14. target: have disease or not (Yes=1; No=0)(=predicted attribute)
